			</hgroup>
			<p>On the morrow <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blydenburg consulted his guidebooks. The descriptions of Fuenterrabia were vague but alluring. The streets, he learned, were narrow; the roofs met; the houses were black with age; the doors were heavy with armorials; the windows barred⁠—in short, a medieval burg that slept on a blue gulf and let Time limp by unmarked. Among the inhabitants were some, he found, who accommodated travelers. The inns, it is true, were unstarred, but the names were so rich in suggestion that the neglect was not noticed. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blydenburg had never passed a night in Spain, and he felt that he would like to do so. This desire he succeeded in awakening in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Incoul, and together they agreed to take an afternoon train, explore the town, pass the evening at the Casino and return to Biarritz the next morning. The programme thus arranged was put into immediate execution; two days after the bullfight they were again on their way to the frontier, and, as the train passed out of the station on its southern journey, Maida and Lenox Leigh were preparing for a stroll on the sands.</p>
			<p>There is at Biarritz a division of the shore which, starting from the ruins of a corsair’s castle, extends on to Saint-Jean-de-Luz. It is known as the Côte des Basques. On one side are the cliffs, on the other the sea, and between the two is a broad avenue which almost disappears when the tide is high. The sand is fine as face powder, <i xml:lang="fr">nuance</i> Rachel, packed hard. From the cliffs the view is delicious: in the distance are the mountains curving and melting in the haze; below, the ocean, spangled at the edges, is of a milky blue. Seen from the shore, the sea has the color of absinthe, an opalescent green, entangled and fringed with films of white; here the mountains escape in the perspective, and as the sun sinks the cliffs glitter. At times the sky is flecked with little clouds that dwindle and fade into spirals of pink; at others great masses rise sheer against the horizon, as might the bastions of Titan homes; and again are gigantic cathedrals, their spires lost in azure, their turrets swooning in excesses of vermilion grace. The only sound is from the waves, but few come to listen. The Côte des Basques is not fashionable with the summer colony; it is merely beautiful and solitary.</p>
			<p>It was on the downs that Maida and Lenox first chose to walk, but after a while a sloping descent invited them to the shore below. Soon they rounded a projecting cliff, and Biarritz was hidden from them. The background was chalk festooned with green; afar were the purple outlines of the Pyrenees, and before them the ocean murmured its temptations of couch and of tomb.</p>
			<p>They had been talking earnestly with the egotism of people to whom everything save self is landscape. The encircling beauty in which they walked had not left them unimpressed, yet the influence had been remote and undiscerned; the effect had been that of accessories. But now they were silent, for the wonder of the scene was upon them.</p>
			<p>Presently Maida, finding a stone conveniently placed, sat down on the sand and used the stone for a back. Lenox threw himself at her feet. From the downs above there came now and then the slumberous tinkle of a bell, but so faintly that it fused with the rustle of the waves; no one heard it save a little girl who was tending cattle and who knew by the tinkle where each of her charges browsed. She was a ragged child, barefooted and not very wise; she was afraid of strangers with the vague fear that children have. And at times during the summer, when tourists crossed the downs where her cattle were, she would hide till they had passed.</p>
			<p>On this afternoon she had been occupying herself with blades of grass, which she threw in the air and watched float down to the shore below, but at last she had wearied of this amusement and was about to turn and bully the cows in the shrill little voice which was hers, when Maida and her companion appeared on the scene. The child felt almost secure; nothing but a bird could reach her from the shore and of birds she had no fear, and so, being curious and not very much afraid, she watched the couple with timid, inquisitive eyes.</p>
			<p>For a long time she watched and for a long time they remained motionless in the positions which they had first chosen. At times the sound of their voices reached her. She wished she were a little nearer that she might hear what they said. She had never seen people sit on the beach before, though she had heard that people sometimes did so, all night, too, and that they were called smugglers. But somehow the people beneath her did not seem to belong to that category. For a moment she thought that they might be guarding the coast, and at that thought an inherent instinctive fear of officials beat in her small breast. She had indeed heard of female smugglers; there was her own aunt, for instance; but no, she had never heard of a coastguard in woman’s clothes. That idea had to be dismissed, and so she wondered and watched until she forgot all about them, and turned her attention to a white sail in the open.</p>
			<p>The white sail fainted in sheets of cobalt. The sun which had neared the horizon was dying in throes of crimson and gamboge. It was time she knew to drive the cattle home. She stood up and brushed her hair aside, and as she did so, her eyes fell again on the couple below. The man had moved; he was not lying as he had been with his back to the bluff; he was kneeling by his companion, her head was on his shoulder, her arms were about his neck, and his mouth was close to hers. The little maid smiled knowingly; she had seen others in much the same attitude; the mystery was dissolved; they were neither guards nor smugglers⁠—they were lovers; and she ran on at once through the bramble and called shrilly to the cows.</p>
			<p>The excursionists, meanwhile, had reached Hendaye and had been ferried across the stream that flows between it and Fuenterrabia. At the landing they were met by a gentleman in green and red who muttered some inquiry. The boatman undid the straps of the valise which they bore, and this rite accomplished, the gentleman in green and red looked idly in them and turned as idly away. The boatman shouldered the valises again, and started for the inn.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Incoul and his friend were both men to whom the visible world exists and they followed with lingering surprise. They ascended a sudden slope, bordered on one side by a high white wall in which lizards played, and which they assumed was the wall of some monastery, but which they learned from the boatman concealed a gambling-house, and soon entered a small grass-grown plaza. To the right was a church, immense, austere; to the left were some mildewed dwellings; from an upper window a man with a crimson turban looked down with indifferent eyes and abruptly a bird sang.</p>
			<p>From the plaza they entered the main street and soon were at the inn. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Incoul and Blydenburg were both men to whom the visible world exists, but they were also men to whom the material world has much significance. In the hall of the inn a chicken and two turkeys clucked with fearless composure. The public room was small, close and full of insects. At a rickety table an old man, puffy and scornful, was quarreling with himself on the subject of a peseta which he held in his hand. The innkeeper, a frowsy female, emerged from some remoter den, eyed them with unmollifiable suspicion and disappeared.</p>
			<p>“We can’t stop here,” said Blydenburg with the air of a man denying the feasibility of a trip to the moon.</p>
			<p>On inquiry they learned that the town contained nothing better. At the Casino there were roulette tables, but no beds. Travelers usually stopped at Hendaye or at Irun.</p>
			<p>“Then we will go back to Biarritz.”</p>
			<p>They sent their valises on again to the landing place and then set out in search of Objects of Interest. The palace of Charlemagne scowled at them in a tottering, impotent way. When they attempted to enter the church, a chill caught them neck and crop and forced them back. For some time they wandered about in an aimless, unguided fashion, yet whatever direction they chose that direction fed them firmly back to the landing place. At last they entered the Casino.</p>
			<p>The grounds were charming, a trifle unkempt perhaps, the walks were not free from weeds, but the air was as heavy with the odor of flowers as a perfumery shop in Bond Street. In one alley, in a bower of trees, was a row of tables; the covers were white and the glassware unexceptionable.</p>
			<p>“We could dine here,” Blydenburg said in a self-examining way. A pretty girl of the <span xml:lang="es">manola</span> type, dressed like a soubrette in a vaudeville, approached and decorated his lapel with a tuberose. “We certainly can dine here,” he repeated.</p>
			<p>The girl seemed to divine the meaning of his words. “<i xml:lang="es">Ciertamente, Caballero</i>,” she lisped.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blydenburg had never been called <i xml:lang="es">Caballero</i> before, and he liked it. “What do you say, Incoul?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“I am willing, order it now if you care to.”</p>
			<p>But the ordering was not easy. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blydenburg had never studied pantomime, and his gestures were more indicative of a patient describing a toothache to a dentist than of an American citizen ordering an evening meal. “<i xml:lang="und">Kayry-Oostay</i>,” he repeated, and then from some abyss of memory he called to his aid detached phrases in German.</p>
			<p>The girl laughed blithely. Her mouth was like a pomegranate cut in twain. She took a thin book bound in morocco from the table and handed it to the unhappy gentleman. It was, he found, a list of dishes and of wines. In his excitement, he pointed one after another to three different soups, and then waving the book at the girl as who should say, “I leave the rest to you,” he dared <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Incoul to go into the Casino and break the bank for an appetizer.</p>
			<p>The Casino, a low building of leprous white, stood in the centre of the garden. At the door, a lackey, in frayed, ill-fitting livery, took their sticks and gave them numbered checks in exchange. The gambling-room was on the floor above, and occupied the entire length of the house. There, about a roulette table, a dozen men were seated playing in a cheap and vicious way for small stakes. They looked exactly what they were, and nothing worse can be said of them. “A den of thieves in a miniature paradise,” thought <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blydenburg, and his fancy was so pleasured with the phrase that he determined to write a letter to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Evening Post</i>, in which, with that for title, he would give a description of Fuenterrabia. He found a seat and began to play. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Incoul looked on for a moment and then sought the reading-room. When he returned Blydenburg had a heap of counters before him.</p>
			<p>“I have won all that!” he exclaimed exultingly. He looked at his watch, it was after seven. He cashed the counters and together they went down again to the garden.</p>
			<p>The dinner was ready. They had one soup, not three, and other dishes of which no particular mention is necessary. But therewith was a bottle of Val de Peñas, a wine so delicious that a temperance lecturer suffering from hydrophobia would have drunk of it. The <span xml:lang="es">manola</span> with the pomegranate mouth fluttered near them, and toward the close of the meal <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blydenburg chucked her under the chin. “Nice girl that,” he announced complacently.</p>
			<p>“I dare say,” his friend answered, “but I have never been able to take an interest in women of that class.”</p>
			<p>Blydenburg was flushed with winnings and wine. He did not notice the snub and proceeded to relate an after-dinner story of that kind in which men of a certain age are said to luxuriate. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Incoul listened negligently.</p>
			<p>“God knows,” he said at last, “I am not a Puritan, but I like refinement, and refinement and immorality are incompatible.”</p>
			<p>“Fiddlesticks! Look at London, look at Paris, New York even; there are women whom you and I both know, women in the very best society, of whom all manner of things are said and known. You may call them immoral if you want to, but you cannot say that they are not refined.”</p>
			<p>“I say this, were I related in any way, were I the brother, father, the husband of such a woman, I would wring her neck. I believe in purity in women, and I believe also in purity in men.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, it’s a good thing to believe in, but it’s hard to find.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Incoul had spoken more vehemently than was his wont, and to this remark he made no answer. His eyes were green, not the green of the cat but the green of a tiger, and as he sat with fingers clinched, and a cheerless smile on his thin lips, he looked a modern hunter of the Holy Grail.</p>
			<p>The night train leaves Hendaye a trifle after ten, and soon a <i xml:lang="es">sereno</i> was heard calling the hour, and declaring that all was well. It was time to be going, they knew, and without further delay they had themselves ferried again across the stream. The return journey was unmarked by adventure or incident. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blydenburg fell into a doze, and after dreaming of the pomegranate mouth awoke at Biarritz, annoyed that he had not thought to address the <span xml:lang="es">manola</span> in Basque. At the station they found a carriage, and, as Blydenburg entered it, he made with himself a little consolatory pact that some day he would go back to Fuenterrabia alone.</p>
			<p>The station at Biarritz is several miles from the town, and as the horses were slow it was almost twelve o’clock before the Continental was reached. Blydenburg alighted there and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Incoul drove on alone to the villa. As he approached it he saw that his wife’s rooms were illuminated. For the moment he thought she might be waiting for him, but at once he knew that was impossible, for on leaving he had said he would pass the night in Spain.</p>
			<p>The carriage drew up before the main entrance. He felt for small money to pay the driver, but found nothing smaller than a louis. The driver, after a protracted fumbling, declared that in the matter of change he was not a bit better off. Where is the cabman who was ever supplied? Rather than waste words <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Incoul gave him the louis and the man drove off, delighted to find that the old trick was still in working order.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Incoul looked up again at his wife’s window, but during his parley with the driver the lights had been extinguished. He entered the gate and opened the door with a key. The hall was dark; he found a match and lit it. On the stair was Lenox Leigh. The match flickered and went out, but through the open door the moon poured in.</p>
			<p>The young man rubbed his hat as though uncertain what to do or say. At last he reached the door, “I am at the Grand, you know,” he hazarded.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I know,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Incoul answered, “and I hope you are comfortable.”</p>
			<p>Leigh passed out. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Incoul closed and bolted the door behind him. For a moment he stood very still. Then turning, he ascended the stair.</p>
